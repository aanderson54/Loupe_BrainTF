 sLDSC estimates the proportion of genome-wide SNP-based heritability that can be attributed to SNPs within a given genomic feature by a regression model that combines GWAS summary statistics with estimates of linkage disequilibrium from an ancestry-matched reference panel. GWAS summary statistics were downloaded for brain-related and other traits. We used the full baseline model (baseline-LD model v2.2.) that included 97 categories capturing a broad set of genomic annotations. Links to GWAS summary statistics are available in the SUpp Tables. Additional files needed for the sLDSC analysis were downloaded from https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE/ following instructions at https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki.
